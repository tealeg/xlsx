This tutorial has been created using https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor].

== Getting started

=== Downloading the package

To import the package, use the line

`import "github.com/tealeg/xlsx/v3"`

in your code. If you are using https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules[go modules], your `go.mod` file should include a `require` line for the package, like so:

`require github.com/tealeg/xlsx/v3 v3.2.0`

_In case you are wondering, why I use the `v3.2.0` version tag, please read the next chapter._

=== Which version of the package do I need for the tutorial?

The `xlsx` package is a living project, so it didn't make sense for me to provide outdated information.
This tutorial covers the `3.x` versions of the package.
You could also use a lot of the content here if you work with the `2.x` branch.
In this case some of the functionality is different (e.g. the `Column` stuff), but the new functionality as well as the bug fixes are well worth an upgrade IMHO.
If you are still using the `v1.0.5` version of the package, I can't promise that you will get a lot out of this tutorial.
For what it's worth, I used this old version until recently when the idea for this tutorial came to my mind.
I quickly realized that I'll get a lot from biting the bullet and upgrading my code (a weekend well spent).
So if you can afford the time, I strongly recommend upgrading to the `3.x` branch of the `xlsx` package.

NOTE: I do recommend using at least Version 3.2.0 of the package because with that release you can now ask a row or a cell for its coordinates. In previous releases this information was not exported in the strcuts.

=== Do you have a sample file?

Yes. I will use a sample file (creatively named `samplefile.xlsx`) for this tutorial that consists of two worksheets.
The first worksheet is named `Sample` and contains this data:

[cols="<,<,>,>",options="header",]
|===
|Name    |Date      |Number |Formula
|Alice   |3/20/2020 |24315  |1215.75 €
|Bob     |4/17/2020 |21345  |1067.25 €
|Charlie |2/8/2020  |32145  |1607.25 €
|===

The second worksheet is named `Cities` and contains a list of the largest cities of the world:

[cols="<,<,>",options="header",]
|===
|City        |Country   |Pop(Mio)
|Tokyo       |Japan     |37.40
|Dehli       |India     |28.51
|Shanghai    |China     |25.58
|São Paulo   |Brazil    |21.65
|Mexico City |Mexico    |21.58
|Cairo       |Egypt     |20.07
|Mumbai      |India     |19.98
|===


== Opening and creating files

Before we create a new file and have to come up with data to fill it, let's open the existing
sample file. To open a file, you use the `OpenFile()` function.

[source,go]
----
// open an existing file
wb, err := xlsx.OpenFile("../samplefile.xlsx")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
// wb now contains a reference to the workbook
// show all the sheets in the workbook
fmt.Println("Sheets in this file:")
for i, sh := range wb.Sheets {
    fmt.Println(i, sh.Name)
}
fmt.Println("----")
----

To create a new, empty xlsx-File, use the `NewFile()` function.

    	wb := xlsx.NewFile()

This function returns a new `xlsx.File` struct.

== Working with sheets

=== Accessing worksheets

The `xlsx.File` struct contains a field `Sheets` that is a slice of pointers to the sheets of the workbook (`[]*xlsx.Sheet`).
You may use this field to access the worksheets in your file.

[source,go]
....
// wb contains a reference to an opened workbook
fmt.Println("Workbook contains", len(wb.Sheets), "sheets.")
....


Most of the time, however you might want to access a specific sheet
directly. To do so, use the field `Sheet`, which is a map with a
string as key and a pointer to a sheet as value
(`map[string]*xlsx.Sheet`). The key is the name of the worksheet.

A simple approach to get a reference to the sheet named "_Sample_"
in our sample file would be like so:

[source,go]
----
sheetName := "Sample"
sh, ok := wb.Sheet[sheetName]
if !ok {
    fmt.Println("Sheet does not exist")
    return
}
fmt.Println("Max row in sheet:", sh.MaxRow)
----

Always make sure to check if the sheet returned from the map does exist.
Otherwise you’ll get a runtime error, because the value of `+sh+` in our
example will still be a `+nil+` value.

=== Creating worksheets

There are two ways to add new content to a workbook: adding (creating) a
new sheet or appending an existing sheet struct to the workbook. Let’s
start with the first method:

[source,go]
....
filename := "samplefile.xlsx"
wb, err := xlsx.OpenFile(filename)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
sh, err := wb.AddSheet("My New Sheet")
fmt.Println(err)
fmt.Println(sh)
....

IMPORTANT: It is important to check for errors when adding new sheets. I’m
writing this as an experienced error maker ;-) – it's quite easy to
forget some of the restrictions for a sheet name in Excel.

Here are the limits you have to keep in mind when naming sheets:

* The minimum sheet name length is 1 character.
* The maximum sheet name length is 31 characters.
* These special characters are also not allowed: :  / ? * [ ]

If any of these rules are violated, the `+AddSheet()+` function will
return an error.

The second method uses an existing `xlsx.Sheet` struct that you
created and calling the `AppendSheet()` function:

[source,go]
....
sh, err := wb.AppendSheet(newSheet, "A new sheet")
....

The first parameter (`newSheet` in the example code line) is the
variable containing the sheet struct. The second parmeter
(`"A new sheet"`) is the name of the new worksheet. The naming rules
from above apply. This function returns a pointer to the newly appended
sheet and an error code. If you do not need the pointer and just want to
check for errors, you can ignore the value using the usual underscore.

=== Closing a worksheet

After you are done working with a sheet and have saved your work, it is
recommended to call `+Close()+` on the sheet. According to Geoff’s
advice in the code: "_Remove Sheet’s dependant resources - if you are
done with operations on a sheet this should be called to clear down the
Sheet’s persistent cache. Typically this happens *after* you’ve saved
your changes._"

== Working with rows and cells

=== The Row

The `xlsx.Row` struct represent a single row in a sheet. You can get a
reference to a certain row by using the function `GetRow(index int)` that
returns a pointer to a row of cells and an error code. Let’s read the
row with the index of 1 (_all number values for rows and columns are
0-based, so we will be reading the *second* row in the sheet_).

[source,go]
....
// sh is a reference to a sheet, see above
row, err := sh.GetRow(1)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
// let's so something with the row ...
fmt.Println(row)
....

The row struct exports only two fields, `Hidden` (a boolean that shows
if the row is hidden or not) and `Sheet` (a pointer back to the sheet
that contains the row).
So how do you access anything in the row?
We’ll see in the chapter about Cells, but let’s see how to add and remove rows first.

==== Where does my data end?

Very good question. Our sample file consists of only four rows in the
`Sample` sheet.

[cols="<,<,>,>",options="header",]
|===
|Name    |Date      |Number |Formula
|Alice   |3/20/2020 |24315  |1215.75 €
|Bob     |4/17/2020 |21345  |1067.25 €
|Charlie |2/8/2020  |32145  |1607.25 €
|===

What if we try to retrieve row #123? Well, we don’t get an error and we
get an empty row. This is where `+Sheet.MaxRow+` comes into play. As you
learned in the chapter about accessing sheets, this field holds the
number of rows in the sheet.

[source,go]
....
sheetName := "Sample"
sh, ok := wb.Sheet[sheetName]
if !ok {
    fmt.Println("Sheet does not exist")
    return
}
fmt.Println("Max row in sheet:", sh.MaxRow)
....

Using the sample file, the output will be: `+Max row in sheet: 4+`.
*Note*: this value is not 0-based (it would have to be 3 then)! Make
sure to check the value of `+MaxRow+` when you need to know how many
rows with data you have in the worksheet.

==== Adding rows

To add a row at the end of the current data, call the `AddRow()`
function of `Sheet`. This returns a pointer to a row struct
(`*xlsx.Row`). There is no need for an error code as the code just
appends a row at the end of the data (adding empty rows, if necessary).

You can also add a row at a certain index position in the sheet by using
the function `AddRowAtIndex(index int)` provided by a sheet. This
function returns a pointer to the row struct *and does return an error
code*. This function also checks if the index is below 0 (as the row
index is 0-based) or the row index is greater than `MaxRow`. Trying to
call `row, err := sh.AddRowAtIndex(123)` for the sample sheet above
would result in an error in `err` and a nil pointer for `row`.

==== Removing rows

To remove a row at a specified row index, call
`RemoveRowAtIndex(index int)` of the `Sheet`. This function returns
just an error code.

==== Iterating rows

The `xlsx.Sheet` provides a callback function to iterate over each row
in the sheet, `ForEachRow()`. The argument is a "_row visitor
function_"; a function that receives a pointer to a row as its
only parameter and returns an error code. Of course you are free to use
an anonymous function, but for the sake of clarity I defined a function
named `rowVisitor()` in the example below:

[source,go]
....
func rowVisitor(r *xlsx.Row) error {
    fmt.Println(r)
    return nil
}

func rowStuff() {
    filename := "samplefile.xlsx"
    wb, err := xlsx.OpenFile(filename)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    sh, ok := wb.Sheet["Sample"]
    if !ok {
        panic(errors.New("Sheet not found"))
    }
    fmt.Println("Max row is", sh.MaxRow)
    err = sh.ForEachRow(rowVisitor)
    fmt.Println("Err=", err)
}
....

The output should resemble the console log below:

[source,shell]
....
== xlsx package tutorial ==
Max row is 4
&{false 0xc00022eb40 0 0 false 0 4 [0xc000294cc0 0xc00022ec00 0xc00022ecc0 0xc00022ed80]}
&{false 0xc00022eb40 0 0 false 1 4 [0xc00022ee40 0xc00022ef00 0xc00022efc0 0xc00022f080]}
&{false 0xc00022eb40 0 0 false 2 4 [0xc00022f140 0xc00022f200 0xc00022f2c0 0xc00022f380]}
&{false 0xc00022eb40 0 0 false 3 4 [0xc00022f440 0xc00022f500 0xc00022f5c0 0xc00022f680]}
Err= <nil>
....

NOTE: If you work with a version *before* `v3.2.0`, there is no way to
know *which* row (in terms of row number) you are receiving at the moment
when using `ForEachRow()`. Starting with `v.3.2.0`, you can use the function
`GetCoordinate()` of the `Row` struct, which will return an integer with
the zero-based row index.

==== Adding a cell to a row

To append a new cell to an existing row, use the function `AddCell()`.
This will return a pointer to a new `Cell`
(I could not find an error check if you already reached the maximum number of cells for the xlsx file).

=== Cells

> If all you know is Excel, every problem looks like rows and columns. +
> -- _me in a requirements workshop_

Cells are the core of any spreadsheet. The `+xlsx+` package provides
ways to access, create and change cells that will be discussed in this
chapter. Before we start with this, let me introduce some neat helper
functions that you will need a lot when working with spreadsheets.

TIP: There are two ways to reference a cell or a cell range in Excel: using
the `A1` notation or using the `RnCn` notation. I will be using the
`A1` notation in this tutorial, but if you have an hour of time and
want to learn why `RnCn` notation is what makes the magic of Excel,
head over to YouTube and watch this video with Joel Spolsky (former
Excel program manager, writer of `Joel on Software`, creator of Trello
and co-founder of Stack Overflow – that’s enough to make you curious 😉):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nbkaYsR94c[Video "You suck at Excel"]

How do you convert a column letter like `A` or `BY` to a zero-baed
column index? Or how to you translate a cell adress like `BY13` to
cartesian coordinated? Luckily the package contains some helper
functions.

* `ColIndexToLetters(index int)` – converts a numeric index to the
letter combination for a cell address.
* `ColLettersToIndex(colLetter string)` – converts a column address to
a numeric index.
* `GetCoordsFromCellIDString(cellAddr string) – converts a cell address
string to row/col coordinates.
* `GetCellIDStringFromCoords(x, y int)` – converts coordinate values to
a cell address

Accessing a single cell can be achieved from the `+Sheet+` struct as
well as form the `Row` struct.

==== Getting a cell from a row

The function `GetCell(colIdx int)` returns the Cell pointer at a given
column index, creating it if it doesn’t exist. That’s the reason there
is no error code. If you try to access a cell that is too far "on the
right", the package will simply extend the row and create the cell
for you.

If you want to add a cell manually, you can do so by calling the
function `AddCell()` of a `xlsx.Row`. This will return a pointer to
a newly created `xlsx.Cell` struct that has been appended to the row you
called the function from.

==== Getting a cell from a sheet

To get a pointer to a cell (and an error code) from a `+Sheet+` struct,
use the function `GetCell(row, col int)`. Internally this will call the
Row’s `GetCell()` function and it will also extend the sheet to match
you coordinated. So make sure to check for `MaxRow` as well as
`MaxCol` if you need to know the data range of the sheet.

==== Iterating over cells

The `Row` provides a callback function to iterate over each row in the
sheet, `ForEachCell()`. The argument is a "_cell visitor
function_". This is a function that receives a pointer to a cell as
its only parameter and returns an error code. Of course you are free to
use an anonymous function, but for the sake of clarity I defined a
function named `cellVisitor()` in the example below. Here’s the
complete listing for do a (very simplistic) dump of a sheet from our
sample file:

[source,go]
....
package main

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/tealeg/xlsx/v3"
)

func cellVisitor(c *xlsx.Cell) error {
    value, err := c.FormattedValue()
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err.Error())
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Cell value:", value)
    }
    return err
}

func rowVisitor(r *xlsx.Row) error {
    return r.ForEachCell(cellVisitor)
}

func rowStuff() {
    filename := "samplefile.xlsx"
    wb, err := xlsx.OpenFile(filename)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    sh, ok := wb.Sheet["Sample"]
    if !ok {
        panic(errors.New("Sheet not found"))
    }
    fmt.Println("Max row is", sh.MaxRow)
    sh.ForEachRow(rowVisitor)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("== xlsx package tutorial ==")
    rowStuff()
}
....

If you didn’t change the sample file, the output should look like this:

----
== xlsx package tutorial ==
Max row is 4
Cell value: Name
Cell value: Date
Cell value: Number
Cell value: Formula
Cell value: Alice
Cell value: 03-20-20
Cell value: 24315
Cell value:  1215.75 €
Cell value: Bob
Cell value: 04-17-20
Cell value: 21345
Cell value:  1067.25 €
Cell value: Charlie
Cell value: 02-08-20
Cell value: 32145
Cell value:  1607.25 €
----

NOTE: If you work with a version *before* `v3.2.0`, there is no way to
know *which* cell (in terms of column and row number) you are receiving at the moment
when using `ForEachCell()`. Starting with `v.3.2.0`, you can use the function
`GetCoordinates()` of the `Cell` struct, which will return an integer pair with
the zero-based column index and the row index.


=== Cell types and content

==== Cell types

The basic data types for an Excel cell are

* Bool
* String
* Formula
* Number
* Date
* Error
* Empty

`xlsx.Cell` provides a `SetXXX()` function for the various data
types (also splitting numeric data in `SetInt()`, `SetFloat()` for
instance).

Date values are stored as numeric value with a date format applied. Yes,
the list above contains a `Date` type, but let me quote the comment in
the code for this:

[source,go]
....
// d (Date): Cell contains a date in the ISO 8601 format.
// That is the only mention of this format in the XLSX spec.
// Date seems to be unused by the current version of Excel,
// it stores dates as Numeric cells with a date format string.
// For now these cells will have their value output directly.
// It is unclear if the value is supposed to be parsed
// into a number and then formatted using the formatting or not.
....

=== Getting cell values

You can retrieve the contents of a cell using these functions

* `Value()` – returns a string
* `FormattedValue()` – return a value with the cell’s format applied
and an error code
* `String()` – returns the cell’s value as a string
* `Formula()` – return a string containing the cell’s formula (or an empty string, if no formula)
* `Int()` - return the cell's content as integer and an error code
* `Float()` - return the cell's content as a float64 and an error code
* `Bool()` - return `true` or `false`
** if cell has `CellTypeBool` and the value equals `1`, return `true`
** if cell has `CellTypeNumeric` and the value is a non-zero, return `true`
** otherwise return `true`, if the result of `Value()` is a non-empty string

=== What's in a cell?

Often you need to find out about the content of a cell because the cell type alone does not suffice.
Why not? Let's have a look.
The sample file contains a sheet "Sample" with content shown below.

[cols="^1,<5,<5,>5,>5",options="header",]
|===
| |A       |B         |C      |D
|**1**|Name    |Date      |Number |Formula
|**2**|Alice   |3/20/2020 |24315  |1215.75 €
|**3**|Bob     |4/17/2020 |21345  |1067.25 €
|**4**|Charlie |2/8/2020  |32145  |1607.25 €
|===

We will have a look at cell `D2` (which is row 1, col 3). The sample code below reads the cell and outputs cell content retrieved using the functions from the last chapter.

[source,go]
----
// let sh be a reference to a xlsx.Sheet

// get the Cell in D1, which is row 0, col 3
theCell, err := sh.GetCell(0, 3)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
// we got a cell, but what's in it?
fv, err := theCell.FormattedValue()
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
fmt.Println("Numeric cell?:", theCell.Type() == xlsx.CellTypeNumeric)
fmt.Println("String:", theCell.String())
fmt.Println("Formatted:", fv)
fmt.Println("Formula:", theCell.Formula())
----

You should get an output that looks like this:

----
Numeric cell?: true
String:  1215.75 €
Formatted:  1215.75 €
Formula: C2*0.05
----

As you see, calling `Type()` for the cell returns "_I'm numeric_".
Which is nice, but not the whole truth, because the cell actually contains a formula.
The formula is shown in the last line of the output.
If you have a "_real_" numeric cell that contains just a number, the result of calling `Formula()` is the empty string.
So if you want to distinguish between these, check if the formula of a cell is empty. Then a numeric cell is really a numeric cell.

=== Setting cell values

To set a cell to a specified value, use one of the `SetXXX()` functions of the `Cell`.
For instance, if you would like to enter a formula for a cell, use the `SetFormula()` function and provide the formula as the string parameter.

=== Formatting cells

When it comes to formatting, we have to distinguish between things like
the display format and styling information like font, color and so on.
Alignment of a cell’s content also belongs to the style information.

==== Number and date formats

To retrieve the format string for a numeric (or date) cell, use the
`GetNumberFormat()` function that will return a string with the
current format information. Setting the format can be achieved using the
function `SetFormat()` (*no "Number" in the function name here*) and
providing a string with the format info.

To make things easier, there are function to set a value as well as a
format, e.g. `SetFloatWithFormat(val float64, fmt string)` so you
don’t have to make two function calls. There even is an exported field
named `NumFmt` to assign a format directly (`SetFormat()` basically
just sets the `NumFmt` field).

There is a whole list of built-in formats for Excel that can be
referenced. For a list of known values, please have a look into the
repository for the `tealeg/xlsx` package at this URL:
https://github.com/tealeg/xlsx/blob/master/xmlStyle.go. Of course you
can also use the same format string and set the format directly using
one of the `...WithFormat()` functions or `SetFormat()`.

Let’s set a numeric format for the cell contained in `c` that will
show negative values in red and uses two digits for the precision:

[source,go]
....
c.NumFmt = "#0.00;[RED]-#0.00"

// alternatively you could use
c.SetFormat("#0.00;[RED]-#0.00")
....

NOTE: The `xlsx.File` struct has an exported field `Date1904`. In most
xlsx-Files the value should be `false`, meaning that the "_base date_"
is the 1st of January, 1900. As noted earlier, Excel stores dates as
numeric values (the number of days elapsed since the "_base date_"). If
the value for `Date1904` is `true`, then the "_base date_" is
January 1st, 1904. The reason for this is a problem with date handling
in the early versions of Excel for the Macintosh, because 1900 was *not*
a leap year. The `tealeg/xlsx` package here automatically processes
this, so there should be no need to worry about this. But if you do
process dates with your own routines, you should check which date ist
"Day Zero". You can find more detiled information about this topic
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/excel/1900-and-1904-date-system[in
this Excel support document] at the Microsoft web site.

=== Styles

Styles provide information about various aspects of the layout and
decoration of cells and can be used from more than one cell. While you
*can* apply a new style for each cell it does not mean you *should* do
this. Why use 300 objects that contain the same information? Better
create a style and re-use it. What’s in a style?

[source,go]
....
// Style is a high level structure intended to provide user
// access to the contents of Style within an XLSX file.
type Style struct {
    Border          Border
    Fill            Fill
    Font            Font
    ApplyBorder     bool
    ApplyFill       bool
    ApplyFont       bool
    ApplyAlignment  bool
    Alignment       Alignment
    NamedStyleIndex *int
}
....

==== Assigning a style

Let’s create a style!

[source,go]
....
myStyle := xlsx.NewStyle()
....

Easy, isn’t it? OK, this returns a pointer to an empty style, so we have
to set some of the fields to a useful value:

[source,go]
....
myStyle := xlsx.NewStyle()
myStyle.Alignment.Horizontal = "right"
myStyle.Fill.FgColor = "FFFFFF00"
myStyle.Fill.PatternType = "solid"
myStyle.Font.Name = "Georgia"
myStyle.Font.Size = 11
myStyle.Font.Bold = true
myStyle.ApplyAlignment = true
myStyle.ApplyFill = true
myStyle.ApplyFont = true
....

Now that we have a style, we can assign this style to a cell (I’ll use
`aCell` as the cell variable) with this statement:
`aCell.SetStyle(myStyle)`. Later in this document you’ll see that
there is a `SetStyle()` function also for columns.

==== Retrieving style info

Using the `GetStyle()` function of a cell returns a pointer to a
`Style` struct. If you never changed the styling, the returned style
will be the default style for the sheet. The code below reads cell 0, 1
(_this is A2_) of the sheet named _Styles_ in the file
`samplefile.xlsx` and displays some of the style information
available. _Please note that for the sake of brevity there is no error
checking. That’s ok in demo code, but don’t do this in production._ 😉

[source,go]
....
package main

import (
    "errors"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/tealeg/xlsx/v3"
    )

func MAIN() {
    filename := "samplefile.xlsx"
    wb, _ := xlsx.OpenFile(filename)
    sh := wb.Sheet["Styles"]
    cell, _ := sh.GetCell(0, 1)
    style := cell.GetStyle()
    fmt.Println("Cell value:", cell.String())
    fmt.Println("Font:", style.Font.Name)
    fmt.Println("Size:", style.Font.Size)
    fmt.Println("H-Align:", style.Alignment.Horizontal)
    fmt.Println("ForeColor:", style.Fill.FgColor)
    fmt.Println("BackColor:", style.Fill.BgColor)
}

== Working with Columns

If there's one topic in the `xlsx` package that did change **a lot** during the major version, it's columns.
So let's see how things work from V3 onward. Personally I strongly recommend upgrading to V3 of the package for the column functionality alone, because it now matches the inner workings of an Excel file much closer.

=== Defining columns

A column structure does _not_ relate to a single column of cells in a worksheet.
Instead, there is at least 1 column definition for a worksheet that can be associated with every column.
The maximum number of columns defined for a worksheet of course equals the number of columns in the sheet (then we would have 1:1 association of column definitions and worksheet columns).

This is the definition of the `Col` struct form the repository:

    type Col struct {
        Min          int
        Max          int
        Hidden       *bool
        Width        *float64
        Collapsed    *bool
        OutlineLevel *uint8
        BestFit      *bool
        CustomWidth  *bool
        Phonetic     *bool
        // contains filtered or unexported fields
    }

You will see that there are two fields, `Min` and `Max` that define the range of worksheet columns this `Col` will be associated with. There is a function called `NewColForRange()` that takes two parameters (min and max) and returns a pointer to a `Col` struct. This is not terribly useful yet unless you set some of the fields and associate this column with the sheet using the
function `SetColParameters()` of the `Sheet` structure.

The code snippet below creates `Col` definition, sets the width and assigns a style. Then we call the `SetColParameters()` function of the sheet to associate this column with the sheet. Any cells in columns A thru E will then have a width of 12.5 and use the style the `myStyle` pointer references (see above).

[source,go]
....
// creating a column that relates to worksheet columns A thru E (index 0 to 4)
newColumn := NewColForRange(0,4)
newColumn.SetWidth(12.5)
// we defined a style above, so let's assigm this style to all cells of the column
newColumn.SetStyle(myStyle)
// now associate the sheet with this column
sh.SetColParameters(newColumn)
....

As you can see, we can write content to any cell in the worksheet's columns A thru E, but there's only one column definition.
Of course you could have created five columns, one for each worksheet columns. If you need five different styles for instance or five different width values, this would be the way to go.
Btw, if you create new `Col` structs and use them in your worksheet, the package takes care of inserting, removing or making way for new columns.

=== Width units ===

Let's imagine you set the width of a column to a value of '12.5'. What does that means? Neither inches nor pixels.
Column width in xlsx files is expressed as the number of characters of the maximum digit width of the numbers 0-9 as rendered in the normal style's font. The value of `12.5` means that (assuming that every digit form 0-9 has the same width in the font) 12.5 digits would fit into a cell of the column.footnote:[Even in proportionally spaced fonts, most of the time digits use the same width to make numeric values in a table easier to read.]

=== Setting the width of a column

You can set the width of a range of columns directly using the `SetColWidth` function of the sheet.
This function has the signature

    func (s *Sheet) SetColWidth(min, max int, width float64)

If you need to set the width of a single column, specify the same value for `min` and  `max`.

When working with a column struct, you can use the `SetWidth` function of a `Column` struct to set the width of all cells that are linked to this column. The function takes one parameter, the width as a `float64`.


== Additional workbook stuff ==

=== Gettting the contents as bytes ===

Maybe you want to handle the result of your work in a special way and not write
the `.xlsx` file to disk. The `xlsx.File` struct has a `Write()` method attached
to it that writes the file to any `io.Writer`. Please see the example below on
how to get the xlsx file as a byte buffer.

[source,go]
....
file := xlsx.NewFile()
/*
    do something with the File...
*/
var b bytes.Buffer
writer := bufio.NewWriter(&b)
file.Write(writer)
theBytes := b.Bytes()
/*
    now you have the byte stream in b.
    if you use some other type that fulfills
    thr Writer interface, go ahead.
*/
....


=== Defined Names (named ranges)

You can define a name for for a cell or a range of cells. This name can
be used in formulas to make things easier to read and understand. This
information is stored in a `definedName` element in the Excel file.
You can access this list of defined names with the `DefinedNames`
field of a `xlsx.File` struct. It holds a slice of pointers to a
`DefinedName` struct (`[]*xlsx.xlsxDefinedName`). There are several
fields for which you can get more detailed information
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/documentformat.openxml.spreadsheet.definedname.aspx[in
this MSDN document]. For our purposes, using `Name` and `Data` is
enough.

* `Name` is a string with a name for a cell or a range of cells.
Usually the name explains the purpose of an object to which this name
refers, making it easier to find and use this object.
* `Data` contains a string with a reference to the cell or cell range

Defining a name is constrained by some syntax rules. Hat tip to
https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/14691/Controls-and-Libraries/Spreadsheet/Defined-Names#syntax-rules-for-names[DevExpress]
for this info!

* The name must start with a letter or the underscore and have a minimum length of 1 character.
* Remaining characters of a name may be letters, the underscore, a digit or a period.
* The single letters ``C'', ``c'', ``R'', or ``r'' cannot be used as defined names.
* A name cannot be the same as a cell reference (for example, `A1`, `$M$15`).
* A name cannot contain spaces (use underscore symbols and periods instead).
* The length of a name cannot exceed 255 characters.
* Names are case-insensitive.

Some examples for `Data` are listed below:

* `Sample!$A$2` – refers to the single cell A2 from the sheet named "Sample"
* `Styles!$A$2:$A$8` – refers to the range from A2 to A8 in the sheet named "Styles"
* `Sheet1!$D$20` – refers to the cell D20 cell on the sheet named "Sheet1"
